## Welcome to GitHub Pages
 You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/weirdcalculator/wptdolphin/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
 Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
 ### Markdown
 Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for
 ```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block
 # Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
 - Bulleted
- List
 1. Numbered
2. List
 **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
 [Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
 For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
 ### Jekyll Themes
 Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/weirdcalculator/wptdolphin/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
